      " \"Bitcoin is currently under attack by short sellers, here's what YOU can do to help. | Bitcoin's nascent market has made it a speculators dream. This having some positives such as increased liquidity for legitimate users, also has its negatives. Those betting against bitcoin, now have enormous profit incentive to do so. Let's make sure it doesn't happen. Short sellers can only borrow a limited amount of BTC before being faced with a short squeeze. 1). Allocate a certain portion of your paycheck towards bitcoin. This strategy practiced over the last 5 years has made people wealthier then they could ever imagine. Bitcoin's current market cap of 7.5bil is still small, there is no reason 75bil cannot be hit. Every $1 spent on bitcoin today may potentially be worth $10 tomorrow. Short sellers will face a dwindling supply of coins to borrow. 2) Do not spend your bitcoin's with Coinbase or Bitpay merchants. Why? Because these merchant's are merely in it for the fiat sales. Coinbase and Bitpay are glorified 1 way exchange services which convert BTC into Fiat, thereby depressing FIAT bid books. This is harmful to liquidity. Stick to business's which SETTLE in bitcoin, after all we are trying to build a financial system that is independent of the legacy monopoly. Coinbase and Bitpay are traditional state sanctioned corporations interested in making a PROFIT for shareholders as well as the government itself. This itself is an anti-thesis to P2P money. 3) Have a sitdown with friends who care. Most people are so hopelessly enamored with the present system mainly due to the state run education system, they will attack any perceived threat against it without even knowing it. These people are not ready for crypto, it is a waste of time to engage them. 4) Stay away from legacy institutions. We aren't here to revolt against the powers that be, we don't have to. With bitcoin we can simply IGNORE THEM. Our silence is the most powerful statement against the accusers and deceivers. In the end, did you really think the state along with the banking cartels would willfully give up their control of money?\"\n",

      " 'US Plan to Delist Chinese Stocks Could Trigger Massive Bitcoin Buying Spree | The mounting tensions between the US and China as a result of the ongoing pandemic have contributed to global instability and could ultimately provide a major boost to Bitcoin. The United States House of Representatives is now spearheading an effort to delist Chinese stocks from the US markets, claiming that they have long been able to benefit from US listings without the companies having to abide by the same rules as domestic companies. If the government is successful in their move to delist these companies, it could provide a major boost to Bitcoin as more Chinese citizens turn to crypto to escape the mounting economic turbulence. Ironically, this effort is being driven by Representative Brad Sherman ‚Äì an outspoken critic of Bitcoin and other digital assets. Tensions Between US and China Mount as Government Moves to Delist Chinese Stocks The ongoing global pandemic has largely been blamed on China by officials within the US government, who now appear to be taking actions to increase the country‚Äôs accountability. In a recent interview with MarketWatch, Representative Sherman noted that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for China to blink first‚Äù while speaking about his newly introduced ‚ÄúHolding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.‚Äù Rep. Sherman, who has long been an adversary of Bitcoin and crypto in general, explained that this newly introduced act isn‚Äôt being floated with the goal of desilting Chinese companies from the US markets, but rather to force them to adhere to the US capital-market standards. ‚ÄúTHE PURPOSE HERE IS NOT TO DELIST OR DE-REGISTER; IT‚ÄôS TO DEMAND THAT CHINA DO WHAT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY HAS DONE AND AGREE THAT IF THEIR COMPANIES WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS, THEY AGREE TO LIVE BY U.S. CAPITAL-MARKETS RULES‚Ä¶TIME FOR CHINA TO BLINK FIRST FOR THE BENEFIT OF INVESTORS,‚Äù HE STATED. If this act is passed, it could create even greater tension between the two countries, potentially having grave impacts on the recently passed trade deal. Rep. Sherman believes that the bill will be successfully passed before the end of summer. Here‚Äôs How This Could Give Bitcoin a Boost Because the delisting of Chinese companies from the US markets could have dire impacts on the country‚Äôs economy, citizens residing there may continue turning to alternative investments like Bitcoin to hedge their portfolios. This growth has been fueled by investors in China and other countries moving to add USD exposure to their portfolios. The imminent inflation that the US dollar will soon see, however, may also lead some of these investors to convert their USDT into Bitcoin in order to avoid the impacts of the United States‚Äô immense money printing, thus giving BTC a major boost.'\n",

I'm just curious to know what you all think. Any thoughts are welcome.\"\n",
      " 'Should Bitcoin be a \"regulator-compliant payment system\" or \"censorship-resistant means of value transfer\"? (The answer is \"Yes!\") | The thought here is simply this: **Instead of the Bitcoin community trying to decide between the two competing drivers of regulatory compliance and censorship resistance, why not take advantage of Bitcoin\\'s \"nigh-fungability\" to pursue both endeavours and allow a market to organically form to enable the movement of bitcoins between the two camps?** Imagine a (very possible) future where major regulators from around the world decide to institute a white listing policy for bitcoin addresses. For transactions to be considered compliant, they would need to start and remain within this network of white listed addresses (or otherwise be white listed). The addresses will be linked to real world identities held on private (at least until hacked) databases under the control of organisations appointed by the regulators. What will this mean? Well, Bitcoin will be split in two. Terrible, yes? Well maybe not. The white listed bitcoins will now be able to comply with all current AML and KYC regulations (including the dreaded [FATF Recommendation 16] The strongest reasons put forward to stop Bitcoin would be moot, at least in the case of white listed bitcoins. The prospects for widespread acceptance would increase dramatically. But we now need to trust a third party? Well, no. The \"free\" bitcoins will still exist. They will still be trust minimised and work could continue to improve their anonymity further. As both free and white listed bitcoins will exist, markets will inevitably form to allow exchange between the two sides of the same bitcoin. Furthermore, as these coins are on the same blockchain, mechanisms will form to move directly between them. For example, claims of \"loss\" or \"theft\" could allow a user to trustlessly convert white listed bitcoins to free bitcoins and government amnesties could provide a free to white listed transfer mechanism. The free bitcoins will gain from the increased resources brought to bitcoin because of its regulated white listed brethren. The white listed bitcoins will gain from the advances in anonymity contributed by the free bitcoin community. White listing is nearly inevitable and it will most likely be enforced by powerful government agencies and implemented external to the Bitcoin protocol. As such, we as a community will be limited in how much we can resist its implementation. However, I hope that the above thought experiment shows that even if white listing were to occur, Bitcoin would be just fine.']\n",

      "[\"Shanghai is bullish for Ethereum | One of the most significant events for the Ethereum blockchain is likely to be the Shanghai upgrade. Currently planned for the second half of 2023, the Shanghai upgrade will implement a number of improvements to Ethereum. Chief among them is the ability for ETH stakes to withdraw both their staked coins and accrued rewards. Users have helped to validate transactions on the so-called Beacon Chain since December 2020, when the proof-of-stake network launched. But so far staking has been a one-way trip: Funds were locked in the deposit contract while Ethereum developers built out the network in real-time. I'm so into tracking everything happening in DeFi, I also started looking more into chain analysis, but there are plenty of tools, these days I'm using Toshi Tools and it seems great. However, I'm sure that this upcoming upgrade has the ability to increase the popularity of ETH staking.

Before if someone where to ask me how ETH is useful I could site concepts like DApps and smart contracts and ICOs etc but what I was describing to them never really felt REAL. As stupid as it sounds CryptoKitties feels REAL. The game elegantly demonstrates both the value of digital scarcity as well as the vast potential of smart contracts in a way that is simple and intuitive. After trying it out for just a few minutes I was suddenly able to imagine dozens of new possibilities for the potential uses of ETH. You could raise virtual race horses and have them race against each other with randomized weighted outcomes and people could make bets and watch the races. You could keep actual Pokemon created by Nintendo and have them battle each other on a world wide arena. You could setup virtual shops in digital worlds like Second Life and sell the products and services directly for ETH. And this was just off the top of my head in like the first 5 minutes. Cryptogaming has the potential to emerge as a whole new genre of gaming where the stakes and outcomes of each game can be linked to something real. As always, I understand there are definitely infinite ways to screw this all up but nonetheless it is exciting to see it in its inception.'\n",

With them being exposed to blockchain at such a young age, the possibility of them implementing that tech into our everyday life, and taking advantage of its perks, would increase drastically. This way Ethereum would technically be considered one of the pioneers since it‚Äôs enabled the building of projects that are funding these activities in a decentralized non-hierarchical manner, something that many universities could benefit from if you ask me.']\n",

      " \"Anybody else bothered by the severe intellectual decline in this subreddit since the hardfork? | There are hardly any technical discussions anymore. r/ethtrader is constantly leaking and its over-invested users are relentlessly spamming this subreddit with attacks against ETC. This is worse than the Bitcoin blocksize drama, people are getting really aggressive, there are organized smear campaigns, public cheering for attacking each other, and so on. Can we please just move forward? If you don't like ETC, sell it and move on. Done. If you don't like ETH sell it and move on. Done.\"\n",
      " \"Peer to peer betting? | I'm a bit new to ethereum, and I'm trying to learn about it by thinking through possible use cases. It seems like a simple use case for ethereum would be a peer to peer betting program. One possible version could work something like this: 1. Receive equal amount of bitcoin from two parties. 2. Query the API that is meant to settle the bet. If the API is down, the bet is off, so return the bitcoins to each party. 3. Award the bitcoins to the winner of the bet. Is this a possible ethereum program? (One question would be--how would the ethereum program control BTC balances while keeping the private key hidden?) Why or why not? Does something like this already exist?\"\n",
      " \"0.8.1 Mist Browser Stops Getting Blocks | I'm running 0.8.1 Mist on Linux and when started it syncs up with the blockchain and connects to peers, but then stops receiving blocks. I've let it go for as long as two hours without getting a block. If I quit it and then reopen it syncs up again and then does not receive any additional blocks. Any one else experiencing the same issue? I know a new release is coming up soon, but wanted to see if this was a known issue or just something I'm dealing with.\"\n",
      " \"Idle Finance interest rates? | Interested in your experience with Idle Finance. I'm wary of the Idle Finance USDC interest rate (currently 20.35%). How can the USDC interest rate be that high if it is rebalancing between Compound (8.86%) and Fulcrum (1.29%)?\"\n",
      " 'If DAO holders lose all, it means 200 million USD less to invest into the Ethereum ecosystem. | We need a fork that will return the coins. I think the DAO should fail and lose all of its money but this is just to much money which would go into this ecosystem by investments by the DAO. If no fork: then 15% will be put on the market for sale which will be horrible, and also 200 million USD less will be invested into Ethereum projects, which horrible as well. The DAO needed a cap when they raised funds. Lesson learned. Return tokens with a fork and dissolve the DAO and start again.'\n",

      " 'Ages investing in cryptocurrencies. (Poll Results) | Pie Chart of results 11 (1 Vote or 0.5%) Most likely a fake \"other\" but I left it. 14-17 (5 Votes or 2.6% 18-25 (75 Votes or 39.7%) 26-35 (69 Votes or 36.5%) 36-45 (22 Votes or 11.6%) 46-55 (14 Votes or 7.4%) 55+ (3 Votes or 1.6%) Hey guys, here are the results of the POLL after almost 20 hours. I found it interested that 18-25 years old is the most populated age group investing in cryptocurrencies and hopefully that means a long bright future for the technology. I figured I\\'d answer some questions and pass them along to you guys for farther discussion in the comments. What age group I\\'m in? 18-25 Age when I began investing? 17, I have known about cryptocurrencies since I was 14-15 years old. I never understood them but knew about them. When I turned 17 I started getting paid in BTC when I sold old shoes/games/etc. Currently I invest in BTC and other alt coins and plan to HODL till the future. How I found out about Cryptocurrencies? I believe I first heard about specifically bitcoin 5 years ago. Someone I played console games with was talking about how it is used in the dark web to transfer money with out the government knowing. Should have invested then haha Theres my story. Hope to hear from more people!'\n",
